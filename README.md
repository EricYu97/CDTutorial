# CDTutorial
This is a simple change detection tutorial based on the ResUnet and a self-made LEVIR-CD dataset. Please check the jupyter notebook for the details.

To run the code, please first unzip the ``LEVIR_CD.zip`` to your local environment.

## Future Development Schedule:

We are developing a unified change detection (UCD) framework that implements more than 18 change detection approaches and have more than 70 available models. The codes will be released [here](https://github.com/EricYu97/UCD).

## More complex models
[MaskCD](https://github.com/EricYu97/MaskCD): MaskCD: A Remote Sensing Change Detection Network Based on Mask Classification
